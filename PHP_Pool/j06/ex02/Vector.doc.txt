<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Vector class handles vectors in space.

A Vector can be constructed if we provide a dest and an orig Vertex.
If orif isn't provided it will be set to (0, 0, 0, 1) by default.

The Vector class provide the following methods:

float magnitude(): get the magnitude of the Vector.

Vector normalize(): return a new instance of the normalized Vector or a clone if the Vector is already normalized.

Vector add(Vector $rhs): add two Vectors.

Vector sub(Vector $rhs): substract two vectors.

Vector opposite(): returns the opposite vector.

Vector scalarProduct($k): returns the product of a Vector and a scalar.

Vector dotProduct(Vector $rhs): returns the scalar product of two Vectors.

float cos(Vector $rhs): returns the cosinus of the angle made up by two Vectors.

Vector crossProduct(Vector $rhs): returns the vectorial product of two Vectors.
